# Understanding the root user

The root user is a privileged user account (UID 0) in Unix and Linux-based operating systems that has full administrative access to all commands and files on the system. It is equivalent to the Administrator account on Windows. The root user has the ability to modify system configurations, manage user accounts, install and uninstall software, and perform other critical system administration tasks.

Is best to avoid the root user unless you know what your doing, or at least have the technical understanding on how to navigate the command line. The root is the most powerful account, and accidental commands can result in breaking the system
