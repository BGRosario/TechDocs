# Understanding Ownership

To determine which permissions a user has, Linux uses ownership.&#x20;

* Every file has a user-owner, a group-owner, and those others&#x20;
* Linux permissions are not additive; if you're the owner, permissions are applied, and that's all.&#x20;
* Use **ls -l** to display current ownership, or if it is a directory, you can use **ls -ld \[DIRECTORY]**
