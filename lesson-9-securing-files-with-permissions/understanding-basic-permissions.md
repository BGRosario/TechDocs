# Understanding Basic Permissions

The basic understanding of file permissions is as shown. Read on files lets you open the files, and on directories, it enables you to list the contents. It applies the same for write and execute as shown in the table.&#x20;

| Permissions | Files        | Directories   |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Read (4)    | Open         | List          |
| Write (2)   | Modify       | Create/Delete |
| Execute (1) | Run the file | Change Dir    |
