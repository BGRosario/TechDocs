# Applying Variables

Variables are used to separate site-specific data from generic code&#x20;

* The shell comes with standard system variables in the environment&#x20;
* Type **env** to show the current value of the environment&#x20;
* Users can define variables using **\[export] key=value**
* Defining your own variables is mainly useful in scripting&#x20;
* To make variables persistent, they should be stored in the startup files
