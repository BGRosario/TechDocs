# Creating and managing local Users

These are some of the commands when creating users (locally to the machine). Infrastructure often includes systems such as LDAP that are not necessarily for local users, which can be confusing.&#x20;

```bash
useradd: create user accounts
usermod: modify user accounts 
userdel: delete user account 
passwd: set passwords
```

Be sure to **man** these commands to learn more about them
